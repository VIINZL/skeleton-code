hey sam

pls install ```npm``` and ```node``` on the system you want to run this on
(latest stable versions)

then run ```npm install``` (that installs the dependencies from package.json)

(actually you need to have ```build-essentials``` installed on the system - for debian based system it should be just ```sudo apt install build -essentials```)

then you should be able to just run
```node index.js```

and the shards should get spawned one at a time :)
